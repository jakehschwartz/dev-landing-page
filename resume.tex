        My main responsibility was the implementation and testing of new features for the backend of the web application but I also worked on the realtime data ingestion pipeline that was the source for the vast majority of the data in the system. \par
        \item Developed and tested several key features for the data pipeline running in Apache Storm.
        \item Created the first tests for the backend search API against Elasticsearch.
        \item Advised the backend engineering team's transition into a more rigid agile and release process using GitFlow.
